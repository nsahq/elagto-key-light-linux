## Example use cases

I have five lights in the room namned: Front Left, Front Right, front center, Rear Right, rear left.

I want to turn all lights on with my StreamDeck by setting a command to:

```bash
./keylights.sh on
```

I want to see the displayName, productName, serialNumber and firmwareVersion of all the lights on the right side of the room in a table:

```bash
./keylights.sh --target '.displayName | contains("Right")' --limit "displayName, productName, serialNumber, firmwareVersion"  --format table --pretty list
```

I want to let my StreamDeck button turn off all lights which contains the name "front" (not case sensitive due to ascii_downcase), i add the following to be a command on button press:

```bash
./keylights.sh --target '.displayName | ascii_downcase | contains("front")' off
```

I want to let my StreamDeck button turn off all lights which contains the name "Left" (case sensitive), I add the following to be a command on button press:

```bash
./keylights.sh --target '.displayName | contains("Left")' off
```
